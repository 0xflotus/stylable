# stylable-scripts

A fork of react-scripts, with the following changes:
- Uses TypeScript instead of Babel, configured to work with Webpack's tree-shaking and dynamic chunks on import();
- Adds built-in support for [Stylable](http://stylable.io/).
- Uses Mocha for Node.js-based tests, and Karma for browser-based tests.
