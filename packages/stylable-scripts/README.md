# stylable-scripts

A fork of react-scripts, with the following changes:
- Uses TypeScript instead of Babel, configured to work with Webpack's tree-shaking and dynamic chunks on import();
- Adds built-in support for [Stylable](http://stylable.io/).

# Getting started

In your terminal, run:
```
$ npx create-react-app --scripts-version stylable-scripts [APP NAME]
```
