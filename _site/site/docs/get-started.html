<h2 id="what-is-stylable">What is Stylable</h2>

<p><strong>Stylable</strong> is a CSS preprocessor that enables you to write reusable, highly-performant, styled components. Each component exposes a style API that maps its internal parts so you can reuse components across teams without sacrificing stylability.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scopes styles to components so they don’t “leak” and clash with other styles.</li>
  <li>Enables custom pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements that abstract the internal structure of a component. These can then be styled externally.</li>
  <li>Uses themes so you can apply different look and feel across your web application.</li>
</ul>

<p>At build time, the preprocessor converts the <strong>Stylable</strong> CSS into flat, static, valid, vanilla CSS that works cross-browser.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-install">How do I install</h2>

<p>There are currently two options for installing and working with <strong>Stylable</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>To begin writing your own project, you can create a <strong>Stylable</strong> app from our boilerplate  - follow the instructions <a href="./getting-started/install-configure.md">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To work with an existing project, you can install <a href="https://github.com/wix/stylable">stylable</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/wix/stylable-integration">stylable-integration</a> packages from GitHub.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>While <strong>Stylable</strong> can work with any component framework, we offer a <a href="./getting-started/react-integration.md">React component integration</a> that works with both installation options.</p>

<p>Optionally, you can install <a href="./getting-started/stylable-intelligence.md"><strong>Stylable Intelligence</strong></a>, an extension providing IDE support for code completion and diagnostics. Currently supported for only Visual Studio Code (version 1.16 and later).</p>
